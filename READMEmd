# Project 5 - *Nested*

Submitted by: **Darian**

**Nested** is a social media app with content tailored to both humans and owls. I think that generating social media content that owls can relate to is a very untapped market. Because of that,
this app allows you to select your species and then it uses an API call to generate posts tailored to you. 

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App has a configured table view and table view call
- [X] App populates the table view with data fetched from an API


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] App fetches posts from a different Tumblr blog
- [X] App has a refresh control to update the table view

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] App allows you to select your species and then shows you content tailored to that species
